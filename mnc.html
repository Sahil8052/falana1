            <span class="text-muted"><br><br><i>Agricultural waste, such as stubble, can be a valuable resource for companies that use it as a raw material. However, it can be difficult for these companies to obtain enough stubble to meet their needs,<br>especially if they do not have the necessary equipment to process it.<br><br>This can lead to decreased production and even business closures, as was the case with the MNC in Punjab you mentioned.
                <br></i>
               <i> Agro Pros aims to address this issue by acting as a intermediary between farmers and companies.<br><br>The platform connects farmers who have excess stubble with companies that need it, allowing both parties to benefit. <br>Farmers can use the platform to sell their stubble and potentially increase their income, while companies can use it to secure a reliable supply of raw materials.<br><br><br> Agro Pros also helps to facilitate the storage and transportation of stubble, making the process more efficient for both parties.
               <br><i>In addition to connecting farmers and companies, Agro Pros has a number of other goals. <br>One of these is to reduce pollution growth by providing an alternative to burning or disposing of stubble.<br> Burning stubble can release pollutants into the air and contribute to air pollution, while disposing of it can lead to environmental degradation.<br><br><br> By finding a use for stubble, Agro Pros can help to reduce these negative impacts.</i>
              
               Agro Pros also aims to help farmers increase their productivity by providing them with resources such as balers. Balers are machines that compress agricultural waste, such as straw or hay, into bales for easier storage and transport. By providing farmers with access to this equipment, Agro Pros can help them to more efficiently manage their waste and potentially increase their profits.              
               <br><br>Overall, Agro Pros is a platform that seeks to bring together farmers and companies in a way that benefits both parties. By providing a way for farmers to sell their excess stubble and for companies to secure a reliable supply of raw materials, Agro Pros can help to support the sustainability of both the farming and manufacturing sectors. Additionally, by reducing pollution and helping farmers to increase their productivity, Agro Pros is working towards important environmental and social goals.
